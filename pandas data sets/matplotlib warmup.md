The objective of this challenge lab is to create your own Graph with Matplotlib. This challenge will test your ability to work with pandas, pandas DataFrames, and select a graph that is a best fit, visually, for your data.

When you finish this lab, be sure to let the class know so we can look at each other's work!

- Review the plots available at https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index
- Try building a plot that is of interest to you with the help of Jupyter notebook.
- Each plot has some example code you can try to get started. Once you have it working, see if you can't customize it a bit.

You're welcome to refer to previous labs to complete this challenge. Here are also some fun datasets that you can choose to use for this activity!
