### COOKIES vs. SESSIONS

- A cookie is a file that is returned by the web server and stores on the client machine

    - A session is a file that remains on the web server and ends when the client's session ends.

- Cookies store session data (a history of what we've already done on a given site)

    - Sessions do the same.

- Cookies will last until they are deleted, so they tend to be more long term.

    - Sessions are more short term; once a client closes the browser or perhaps is inactive for more than 30 minutes.

- Cookies are easy to edit/change by clients.

    - Sessions are encrypted; they tend to hold more sensitive data.
