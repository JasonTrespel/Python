1. Before this challenge begins, do the following:

    `student@bchd:~$` `sudo apt install sl`

    `student@bchd:~$` `/usr/games/sl`

0. WHEEEEEEE!!! Uninstall `steam locomotive` and confirm it's uninstalled. Sad, I know.

    `student@bchd:~$` `sudo apt remove sl -y`
    
    `student@bchd:~$` `/usr/games/sl`
    
## GOOGLE CHALLENGE:

You'll need to either refer to previous labs or use Google to do the following. Write a Python script that will: 

- install `sl` on your machine again.
- creates a new directory in `mycode` called "slappy"
- create a new file in the new `slappy` directory called "chad_stop_using_that_word.txt"
