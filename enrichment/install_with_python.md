1. Before this challenge begins, do the following:

    `student@bchd:~$` `sudo apt install sl`

    `student@bchd:~$` `/usr/games/sl`

0. WHEEEEEEE!!! Uninstall `steam locomotive` and confirm it's uninstalled. Sad, I know.

    `student@bchd:~$` `sudo apt remove sl -y`
    
    `student@bchd:~$` `/usr/games/sl`
    
## GOOGLE CHALLENGE:

Write a Python script that will install `sl` on your machine again. It needn't be complicated!
