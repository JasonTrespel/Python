Let's crunch some data! Run the following steps:

`cd ~/mycode`

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csfeeser/Python/master/data%20sets/pandas%20practice/cars1.csv`

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csfeeser/Python/master/data%20sets/pandas%20practice/cars2.csv`

These two CSV files contain data on used cars. Using what we learned yesterday in labs 16 and 17, try out the following objectives!

### DO THESE FIRST:

- Add both cars1.csv and cars2.csv as dataframes to your project.
- `.concat()` the dataframes together
- Change the index to the "Stock #" column.

### Choose any combination of the following to try! See if you can solve at least two.

- Find the top 10 most expensive cars
- Which car has the least amount of miles on it (lowest odometer)
- If all the cars on the lot were swept away in a tornado, how much money would we lose?
- Cars without photos don't sell. Delete all rows where photo count = 0.
- Output your dataframe as a file, using whatever file type you wish
