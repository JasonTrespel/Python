Using the tools/scripts that you've been shown with [Beautiful Soup](https://github.com/csfeeser/Python/blob/071f58160babb4568091a8eb0223070b52d88931/TLG/webscraping.md), attempt your own webscrape!

Choose between one of the two websites below:

- [300 Flower Names and Types with Pictures](https://florgeous.com/types-of-flowers/)

- [The Epic List of 250 Legendary Swords](https://hobbylark.com/fandoms/The-Epic-List-of-250-Legendary-Swords)

In both sites, you're presented with a long list of data (names of flowers or swords) as well as a description of each item. Using Beautiful Soup, return ALL the flowers/swords AND THEIR DESCRIPTIONS from the page and place them inside of a dictionary. The format of the dictionary is up to you- what do you think will be the best design?
