# Networking Automation Project

In class we learned how to utilize two popular third party networking tools: Paramiko and Netmiko. Paramiko is used for the provisioning of computers in a network, while Netmiko automates sending commands to networking devices.

#### This project is flexible and you are free to choose between two different options.

### OPTION #1: Writing

There are lots of things you can do with Paramiko and Netmiko that we have not done in class! Write code that either automates action against bender, fry, and/or zoidberg (Paramiko) or sw-1/sw-2 (Netmiko). Feel free to start with one of our scripts from labs 65, 66, or 67 and build on them!

- [More ways to use the SSHClient from Lab 66!](https://docs.paramiko.org/en/stable/api/client.html)

### OPTION #2: Research

Being able to read code is just as (if not more) important than writing code. There is a LOT of pre-written code out there... after all, why reinvent the wheel? For this option, choose either of the links below- the code works great but is very poorly commented.
Add a comment to EVERY LINE explaining what that line of code does!

#### CHOOSE EITHER PARAMIKO OR NETMIKO, YOU DON'T NEED TO DO BOTH

PARAMIKO DEMO CODE: Choose ONE (this code is longer)

#### OR

NETMIKO DEMO CODE: Choose THREE (this code is shorter)
