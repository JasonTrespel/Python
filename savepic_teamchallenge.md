# SAVE & DISPLAY A PICTURE... TEAM CHALLENGE!

### Before you begin, you'll need to install these three third-party modules. Be sure you have them.

    python3 -m pip install wget
    sudo apt install python3-tk
    python3 -m pip install requests

## Objective
You and your teammates will each choose one of the challenges below. Each of you will write a function that exactly fulfills the objective. By combining your code, you'll be able to access an API, pull an image URL from it, downloads the image to your local machine, and displays it in two different ways!

#### TEAM 1:
- Write a function that pulls the API of a user-selected Pokemon  from PokeAPI.
example: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/bulbasaur/)
- Have the function return that link.

#### TEAM 2:
- Write a function that slices through a PokeAPI page and returns the value of "front_default" (it will be a URL to an image). 
- Have the function return that URL!

#### TEAM 3:
- Write a function that uses the wget module to download the image from the link. 
- This page shows you how (https://likegeeks.com/downloading-files-using-python/#Using-wget)

#### TEAM 4:
- Write a function that takes an image link and opens it in a browser! (you'll need to use your virtual desktop to test!) 
- Hmm... didn't we already do that with another lab?...

#### TEAM 5:
- Write a function that uses the Turtle module. Use Turtle to open a local image file and display it (you'll need to use your virtual desktop to test!) 
- Hmm... didn't we already do that with another lab?...
