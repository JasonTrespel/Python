# Python to Cisco NX-OS

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to demonstrate Python connectivity to a Cisco NX-OS platform, specifically one running the Cisco Nexus 9k software (switch). This lab is comprised of two main components; the first is exposing the API on the device, the second is writing Python code to interact with the Cisco API itself.  
Cisco makes writing code for their devices easy via their NX-API sandbox. This is available for users by navigating to management IP of the NX-OS platform after enabling the NX-API via ssh. **THIS LAB REQUIRES INSTALLING CISCO VPN CLIENT. This lab is READ-ONLY if you do not have sufficient privileges to install software.**

### Procedure

1. Make a Cisco DevNet account by accessing https://developer.cisco.com/site/nx-os/

0. At the bottom of the screen click the `1 Node Reservable` button.

0. If you don't have a DevNet account this begins the signup process. Complete this process before continuing.

0. Once you have an account, you will reach the "blueprint" page. Press the `reserve` button in the upper right corner. This will take 10 minutes to launch.

0. You'll receive multiple emails. The important one will be received after the 10 minutes are finished.

0. Inside the final email is a link that says "Download the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client Software." Click this link to download a zip file. Unzip the file.

0. The VPN client to install is named "anyconnect-win-4.9.04043-core-vpn-predeploy-k9.msi" (the version may have increased since publication)

0. After installing the software, launch Cisco Anyconnect Secure Mobility Client (this can be found in the Windows Start menu)

0. When the Cisco AnyConnect software begins, you'll need to copy the lab network address from the final e-mail you received. Paste this into the Cisco AnyConnect software prompt.

0. Next you'll be prompted for your username and password (all of which is in your "Your Cisco DevNet Sandbox Lab is Ready" email)

0. To connect to the NX-OS toolserver (which is really just a Linux server), open putty on your personal machine.

0. Begin an ssh putty session to the IP address of the model NX-OS toolserver. This IP address is available on the blueprint screen along with the username and password. At the time of this writing, the toolserver credentials are `root` and `cisco123`

0. From your Linux server we now need to ssh into the switch to activate the API. This IP address is available on the blueprint screen along with the username and password. At the time of this writing, the switch credentials are `admin` and `Cisco123`

    `[root@localhost ~]#` `ssh admin@xx.xx.xx.xx`
    
0. Put the switch into configuration mode.

    `switch-n9kv#` `conf t`

0. The prompt will change. The command below will expose the API.

    `switch-n9kv(config)#` `feature nxapi`

0. By default the API uses HTTPS protocol (port 443). For simplicity, we will enable HTTP (port 80). In production it is not advisable to ever run in HTTP mode.

    `switch-n9kv(config)#` `nxapi http port 80`
    
0. Check your work. You should see the API is exposed on port 443 and port 80.

    `switch-n9kv(config)#` `show nxapi`

0. Exit configuration mode but do not exit the switch.

    `switch-n9kv(config)#` `exit`

0. In your local browser, open a tab to https://xx.xx.xx.xx (use the IP address of your switch) and enter your login info (`admin` and password `Cisco123` were the username/password at publication)

0. In the top window type a Cisco CLI command. Something simple like `show ver` is fine.

0. Take some time to examine what's being presented to you. An HTTP POST was created on your behalf. You are being presented with JSON attached to the post (form data) as well as the JSON response that came back on a 200.

0. Over in the switch CLI, issue the same command, `show ver`

    `switch-n9kv#` `show ver`

0. Compare the CLI response to the response presented to you on the NX-API sandbox page. The content should be the same, however the JSON is **far easier** to parse and useful for automation purposes.

you have now is the ability to type a cli command. Type `show ver` in the browser and hit "send"

if you click on the tabs below (request, python, python3, java, javascript, go-lang) they actually give you the code needed to send a post.

Copy the python code and go back to putty ssh. hit exit twice until you're back to root@localhost. We leaft the switch and we're back in the tool machine.

`vi showver01.py`
use shift insert to paste that python code in.
change the value of switchuser and switchpassword (admin and Cisco123)

python showver01.py
