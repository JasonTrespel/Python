## THURSDAY MORNING CHALLENGE
### Introduction to APIs

1. Copy/paste the dictionary "astro" below into your script. As of 10:39am ET 7/30/20, these are all astronauts currently aboard the International Space Station (ISS)! See for yourself at http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json.

```
astro= {"message": "success", "number": 5, "people": [{"craft": "ISS", "name": "Chris Cassidy"}, {"craft": "ISS", "name": "Anatoly Ivanishin"}, {"craft": "ISS", "name": "Ivan Vagner"}, {"craft": "ISS", "name": "Doug Hurley"}, {"craft": "ISS", "name": "Bob Behnken"}]}
```

2. Write a line that returns how many people are currently aboard the ISS.

3. Using a FOR LOOP, pull the names of each astronaut and the craft they are currently aboard.

Your final output should look like this:

```
People in Space: 3

Chris Cassidy is on the ISS
Anatoly Ivanishin is on the ISS
Ivan Vagner is on the ISS
Doug Hurley is on the ISS
Bob Behnken is on the ISS
```

### NO CHEATING! Both the name of the astronaut and the name of the craft (ISS) has to come from the dictionary :)

### No, you can't modify the dictionary!
