1. Their code is a little bit busted. But thankfully we have a dashing developer who fixed it up for us to use. So let's download the *working* code now.
    
    `wget https://static.alta3.com/courses/python/swagger_flask_petstore.tar`

0. Next up we will need to unpack this little tarball.
   
   `tar -xvf swagger_flask_petstore.tar`

0. Move into the swagger_flask_petstore directory.
    
    `cd swagger_flask_petstore`

0. Perform a pip install of all of our requirements.
   
   `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

0. Now start up your server by calling on the module's name.
   
   `python3 -m swagger_server`

0. Go to aux1 and the add the following onto your path: `/alta3/python_api_example/1.0.0/ui/`
