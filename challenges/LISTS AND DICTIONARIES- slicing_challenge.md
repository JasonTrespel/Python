1. For your morning challenge, attempt the following:

    - From the *challenge* list, pull the strings *eyes, goggles,* and *nothing* and create a print function that returns this output:
        ```
        My eyes! The goggles do nothing!
        ```
    - From the *trial* list, pull the strings *eyes, goggles,* and *nothing* and create a print function that returns this output:
        ```
        My eyes! The goggles do nothing!
        ```
    - From the *nightmare* list, pull the strings *eyes, goggles,* and *nothing* and create a print function that returns this output:
        ```
        My eyes! The goggles do nothing!
        ```
0. You're not allowed to edit any of the lists :)

0. When your script runs, it should output the following:

    ```
    My eyes! The goggles do nothing!
    My eyes! The goggles do nothing!
