## CHALLENGE: Grandma For-Loops

![Image description](https://media1.tenor.com/images/86af9df2f38dc57e462e6b402775c37e/tenor.gif)

*In writing Python, what we're often trying to emulate in our code are the behaviors of real-life objects, places, people, and processes. Though kinda silly, doing this lab will help nudge us to understand how OOP (Object Oriented Programming) works!*

### Example


    # For every [dish] I find in the [sink] I'm going to [scream].

    sink= ["bowl","plate","fork","mug"]
    for dish in sink:
        print(f"There's a dirty {dish} in the sink! AAAAGGGHH!")

OUTPUT:

    There's a dirty bowl in the sink! AAAAGGGHH!
    There's a dirty plate in the sink! AAAAGGGHH!
    There's a dirty fork in the sink! AAAAGGGHH!
    There's a dirty mug in the sink! AAAAGGGHH!

    
### Procedure

1. **Counter**- Choose ONE of these grandma threats. Replicate this grandma behavior in Python code- you must use a for loop!

    - *For every [biscuit] I find in your [room] I'm going to [flog you]!*
    - *For every [broccoli] I find on your [plate] I'm going to [slap you].*
    - *For every [dirty dish] I find in your [room], that's how many times I'm going to [whoop your ass].*

0. **Delete**- Choose ONE of these grandma threats. Each of these is threatening to make a NEGATIVE CHANGE to your data! Replicate this in Python code including a for loop!

    - *For every [toy] I find in the [hallway] I'm going to [throw them away]!*
    - *For every [light] I find on in an empty [room] I'm going to [take a dollar]!*
    - *For every [inside out sock] I find in the [laundry], I'm going to throw it in the [trash].*

0. **Add**- Choose ONE of these grandma threats. Each of these is threatening to make a POSITIVE CHANGE to your data! Replicate this in Python code including a for loop!

    - *Grandma says for every [penny] she finds on the [ground], she puts [1 cent] in her piggy bank to save up for the great depression.*
    - *For every [A] I find in your [report card] I'm going to give you a new [video game] for your collection.*
    - *For every [F] I find in your [report card] I'm going to put another [snake] in your bed.*
