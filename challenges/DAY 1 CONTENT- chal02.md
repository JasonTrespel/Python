**Objective:** Make the following output using the following list:

1. Include this list: 
    
    ```
    icecream= ["indentation", "spaces"] 
    ```

2. Include this list:

    ```
    tlgstudents= ["Aaron","Alex","Alonzo","Brandon","Chris","Francisco","James","Jonathan","Lillian","Manuel","Patrick","Robert","Ryan","Troy","Wes","Henry","Yalined"]
    ```
    
3. Append the integer **(not string!)** `4` to the list `icecream`.

4. Include an input asking for a number between 0 and 5. Use this number to identify one of the students from the *northerntrust* list!
    > remember that *input()* always returns a string... look at the *int()* built-in function!

5. Using the appended list and the input, make this output (emphasis placed):

   ```
   <student name> always uses <4> <spaces> to indent.
   ```

**SUPER BONUS**

Find a way to randomize what student is picked!

**MEGA BONUS**

If the user types in a name instead of a number, use the name instead!
