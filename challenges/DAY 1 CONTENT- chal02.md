**Objective:** Make the following output using the following list:

1. Include this list: 
    
    ```
    icecream= ["flavors", "salty"] 
    ```

2. Include this list:

    ```
    northerntrust= ["Bala", "Inderjeet", "Jon", "Nikita", "Steve", "Vinod"]
    ```
    
3. Append the integer **(not string!)** `99` to the list `icecream`.

4. Include an input asking for a number between 0 and 5. Use this number to identify one of the students from the *northerntrust* list!
    > remember that *input()* always returns a string... look at the *int()* built-in function!

5. Using the appended list and the input, make this output (emphasis placed):

   ```
   <99> <flavors>, and <student name> chooses to be <salty>.
   ```

**SUPER BONUS**

Find a way to randomize what student is picked!

**MEGA BONUS**

If the user types in a name instead of a number, use the name instead!
