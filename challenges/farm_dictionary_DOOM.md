![Image description](https://github.com/csfeeser/TLG-Python/blob/master/skill%20level.png?raw=true)

#### Challenge Level will be determined by the DOOM2 Difficulty Scale

```
farms = [{"name": "NE Farm", "agriculture": ["sheep", "cows", "pigs", "chickens", "llamas", "cats"]},
         {"name": "W Farm", "agriculture": ["pigs", "chickens", "llamas"]},
         {"name": "SE Farm", "agriculture": ["chickens", "carrots", "celery"]}]
```

### Hey, Not Too Rough

• Write a for loop that returns all the animals from the NE Farm!

### Hurt Me Plenty

• Ask a user to choose a farm (NE Farm, W Farm, or SE Farm). Return the plants/animals that are raised on that farm.

### NIGHTMARE

• Ask a user to choose a farm (NE Farm, W Farm, or SE Farm)... but only return ANIMALS from that particular farm.
