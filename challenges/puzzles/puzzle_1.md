# PUZZLE 1: Accountant Goblins

### SCENARIO PART 1:

Hooray! You've finally earned enough vacation time to take that big trip you always wanted! But SUDDENLY- disaster hits.

Before you leave, the goblins in accounting just need you to fix your expense report; apparently, something isn't quite adding up.

Specifically, they need you to **find the two entries that sum to 2020** and then **multiply those two numbers together.**

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

    1721
    979
    366
    299
    675
    1456

In this list, the two entries that sum to `2020` are `1721` and `299`. Multiplying them together produces `1721 * 299 = 514579`, so the correct answer is `514579`.

Of course, your expense report is much larger. **CREATE A FUNCTION** to find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

### SCENARIO PART 2:

The goblins in accounting are thankful for your help-- but you're not done yet. They need you to find three numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.

Using the same expense example as before...

    1721
    979
    366
    299
    675
    1456
    
...the three entries that sum to `2020` are `979`, `366`, and `675`. Multiplying them together produces the answer, `241861950`.

In your expense report, **CREATE A FUNCTION** that finds the three entries that sum to 2020 and multiply them together.
