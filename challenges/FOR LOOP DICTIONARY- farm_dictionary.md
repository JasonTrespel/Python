```
farms = [{"name": "NE Farm", "agriculture": ["sheep", "cows", "pigs", "chickens", "llamas", "cats"]},
         {"name": "W Farm", "agriculture": ["pigs", "chickens", "llamas"]},
         {"name": "SE Farm", "agriculture": ["chickens", "carrots", "celery"]}]
```

### Function 1

• Write a for loop that returns all the animals from the NE Farm!

### Function 2

• Ask a user to choose a farm (NE Farm, W Farm, or SE Farm). Return the plants/animals that are raised on that farm.

### Function 3

• Ask a user to choose a farm (NE Farm, W Farm, or SE Farm)... but only return ANIMALS from that particular farm.

### SUPER BONUS

Test the flexibility of your code... does it still work if you swap the value of farms for this?

```
farms = [{"name": "SE Farm", "agriculture": ["chickens", "carrots", "celery"]},
         {"name": "NE Farm", "agriculture": ["sheep", "cows", "pigs", "chickens", "llamas", "cats"]},
         {"name": "E Farm", "agriculture": ["bananas", "apples", "oranges"]},
         {"name": "W Farm", "agriculture": ["pigs", "chickens", "llamas"]}]
```
