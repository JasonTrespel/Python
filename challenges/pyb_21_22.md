Python's popularity comes from the fact that it had a REDONKULOUS library of pre-written code that saves you the time/effort/skill of writing it yourself! The Python library is like a Swiss army knife- a tool for every occasion!

Below is a dictionary taken from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). What's annoying about this resource is that much of the data it returns is in HTML format (those weird `&#039;` characters you see below).  

FORTUNATELY, there's a tool for that! The `html` module can clean that up for us. You'll need the documentation in the link below to solve the challenge. 

[Click here to read about the HTML module!](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html)

#### Objective:
- create a script that includes the `trivia` dictionary below.
- Slice and print out the trivia question and the four answers (one correct, three incorrect) from the dictionary.
- Use the `html` library to render the question/answers in the proper format.
- **BONUS:** have the user answer A, B, C, or D and see if they guess the answer correctly!

```python

trivia= {
         "category": "Entertainment: Film",
         "type": "multiple",
         "question": "Which of the following is NOT a quote from the 1942 film Casablanca? ",
         "correct_answer": "&quot;Frankly, my dear, I don&#039;t give a damn.&quot;",
         "incorrect_answers": [
             "&quot;Here&#039;s lookin&#039; at you, kid.&quot;",
             "&ldquo;Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine&hellip;&rdquo;",
             "&quot;Round up the usual suspects.&quot;"
            ]
        }
```
