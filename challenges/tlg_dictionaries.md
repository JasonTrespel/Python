  - Adds another key/value pair to the dictionary

  - Using a *method* from the lab you just did, return a list of all the keys in your dictionary.

  - Ask for input from the user to type in one of those keys displayed in that list. Save it as the variable `choice`.

  - Use the variable `choice` to access your dictionary and return the appropriate value.

  ```
