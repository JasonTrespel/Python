### This is a commonly used challenge to see if applicants actually know how to code! We'll add in some other requirements, however, to help review some of the content we've learned this week with Python.

Start by running the following command:

`student@bchd:~$` `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csfeeser/Python/master/challenges/numfile.txt`

Now write a script that does the following:

1. Write a **function** that reads in `numfile.txt` (what you just downloaded). Convert the contents of the file into a **LIST**. Your function must **return the list.**

0. Loop across this new list (yes this is redundant, don't come at me), but the loop must do the following:
  - If the element is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
  - If the element is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
  - If the element is a multiple of both 3 AND 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
  - If none of the above are true, just print the number.

**SUPER BONUS**: Return how many *Fizz*es, *Buzz*es, and *FizzBuzz*es there are.

**MEGA BONUS**: Make this script as SHORT AS POSSIBLE!
