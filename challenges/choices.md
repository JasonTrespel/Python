# Code Customization Choices!

You may choose which API you will continue to explore! Below are the links to your options:

### 1. Astronomical Picture of the Day (APOD)

   - Get input from the user to choose the date the image is returned from!
   - Download the image that gets returned to your `/home/student/static/` directory!
   - Either force the API to return thumbnails instead of videos, or reject any responses that have anything other than "image" as the value of "media_type".
 
### 2. Mars Rover

Get input from the user to choose:
   - WHICH rover they are returning information from
   - What earth date the picture was taken
   - Which camera the image was taken from
   
### 3. NeoWS (ASTEROIDS!)

This is a GREAT challenge to anyone who really wants to test their for loop skills! Implement the following:
   - return how many asteroids were present in that range
   - return how many asteroids were potentially hazardous in that range.
   - in terms of kilometers, what was the biggest asteroid in that range? The fastest? The closest?
