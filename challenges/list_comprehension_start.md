**COPY/PASTE the following into a new Python script in your machine:**

```python
folks= ["David", "Elena", "Emily", "Chad", "Haley", "Jim", "Jonathan", "Matt", "Mike"]

coolfolks= []
```

Use a **for loop** to loop over the list `folks`. If the person's name isn't "Chad", then append that person to the list `coolfolks` (Chad isn't cool).
