## CHALLENGE: Grandma For-Loops

![Image description](https://media1.tenor.com/images/86af9df2f38dc57e462e6b402775c37e/tenor.gif)

*For loops are tricky, but essential! What can help in understanding for loops is connecting them to the "threats" that some of the grandparents in our lives have made to us :)*

### Example


    # For every [dish] I find in the [sink] I'm going to [scream].

    sink= ["bowl","plate","fork","mug"]
    for dish in sink:
        print(f"There's a dirty {dish} in the sink! AAAAGGGHH!")

OUTPUT:

    There's a dirty bowl in the sink! AAAAGGGHH!
    There's a dirty plate in the sink! AAAAGGGHH!
    There's a dirty fork in the sink! AAAAGGGHH!
    There's a dirty mug in the sink! AAAAGGGHH!

    
### Procedure

1. **Counter**- Choose ONE of these grandma threats. Here for every instance of an object, we are making an action. The number of objects = number of actions! Replicate this grandma behavior in Python code- you must use a for loop!

    - *For every [biscuit] I find in your [room] I'm going to [flog you]!*
    - *For every [broccoli] I find on your [plate] I'm going to [slap you].*
    - *For every [dirty dish] I find in your [room], that's how many times I'm going to [whoop your ass].*
    - *For every [cigarette butt] I find [in the trash] I'm going to make you [smoke a pack].*
    
0. **Delete**- Choose ONE of these grandma threats. Each of these is threatening to make a NEGATIVE CHANGE to your data! Replicate this in Python code including a for loop!

    - *For every [light] I find on in an empty [room] I'm going to [take a dollar]!*
    - *For every [bad word] that [you say] I'm going to [slap a tooth out] of your [mouth].*
    - *For every [toy] I find in the [hallway] I'm going to [throw them away]!*
    - *For every [inside out sock] I find in the [laundry], I'm going to throw it in the [trash].*
    
0. **Add**- Choose ONE of these grandma threats. Each of these is threatening to make a POSITIVE CHANGE to your data! Replicate this in Python code including a for loop!

    - *Grandma says for every [penny] she finds on the [ground], she puts [1 cent] in her [piggy bank] to save up for the great depression.*
    - *For every [A] I find in your [report card] I'm going to give you a new [video game] for your [collection].*
    - *For every [F] I find in your [report card] I'm going to put another [snake] in your [bed].*
    - *For every [lego] I find on the [floor], your dad will put another [dollar] in my [money jar].*

0. **BONUS**- Below is data that has been made for you:

    ```
    kitchen= {"pan":"tool","spoon":"tool","yo-yo":"toy","banana":"food","jump rope":"toy","stove":"appliance"}
    ```

    - *For every [toy] I find in the [kitchen] I'm going to [scream]!*
    - You may only identify whether or not a key/value pair in this dictionary is a toy by the VALUE.

0. **SUPER BONUS**
    
    - Solve the bonus above with only TWO LINE (not counting the dictionary *kitchen*)

0. **MEGA BONUS**

    - Solve the bonus above... with only ONE line! (not counting the dictionary *kitchen*)
