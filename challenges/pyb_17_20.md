### After you're done, try the following:

#### Part 1

Take the following code:

```python
pokedex={"Bulbasaur":"Grass/Poison",
         "Squirtle":"Water",
         "Charmander":"Fire"}

choice= input("Name a Generation 1 starter Pokemon:\n>")

print(pokedex[choice])
```

**Objective:** IMPROVE the code so that if the user types in a pokemon not in `pokedex`, instead the output looks like this:

```
Sorry, we don't have any record of that Pokemon!
```

Look at how the .get() method is used in lab 17, step 11!
</details>

#### Part 1 SOLUTION

```python
pokedex={"Bulbasaur":"Grass/Poison",
         "Squirtle":"Water",
         "Charmander":"Fire"}

print(pokedex.get(choice, "Sorry, we don't have any record of that Pokemon!"))
```

#### Part 2

Continue with the code from part 1 (including the changes you've already made)

**Objective:** BEFORE asking the user to choose a pokemon, ADD the following key/value pair to the `pokedex` dictionary. Do not edit the dictionary itself :)

```
"Pikachu":"Electric"
```

</details>

#### Part 2 SOLUTION

```python
pokedex={"Bulbasaur":"Grass/Poison",
         "Squirtle":"Water",
         "Charmander":"Fire"}

pokedex["Pikachu"] = "Electric"

choice= input("Name a Generation 1 starter Pokemon:\n>")

print(pokedex.get(choice, "Sorry, we don't have any record of that Pokemon!"))
```

#### Part 3

Continue with the code from parts 1 and 2 (including the changes you've already made)

**Objectives:**
- Print out a LIST of all the Pokemon in the `pokedex` dictionary so the user knows what Pokemon are available!
- **BONUS:** Use `.join()` on that list so it looks nice and neat, like so:

```
Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander, Pikachu
```

Look at how the .join() method is used in lab 20, step 9!
</details>

#### Part 3 SOLUTION

```python
pokedex={"Bulbasaur":"Grass/Poison",
         "Squirtle":"Water",
         "Charmander":"Fire"}

pokedex["Pikachu"] = "Electric"

# pokedex.keys() is a list of keys
# .join can be used to join elements in a list together
x= ", ".join(pokedex.keys())

print(x)

choice= input("Name a Generation 1 starter Pokemon:\n>")

print(pokedex.get(choice, "Sorry, we don't have any record of that Pokemon!"))
```
