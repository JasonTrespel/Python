Part 1: Create a new script called "db_challenge.py". Use the code from previous examples to build functions that will do the following: 
           1. Create a table called "company"
           2. Insert data into the table (as written in database03.py is fine for now)
           3. Select information from the table
           4. Update information for a specific line in the table
           5. Delete an entry for a given line in the table
        Prove that each of the functions work by having them run when you start your code.
Part 2: Update the functions created above to accept parameters. These may include things such as:
           - What table should be created (it's name - and possibly columns for it)? -- name
           - What data should be written to said table?  -- name, age, salary, table_name, etc...
           - What information would you like returned from what table? -- name, age, salary, table_name, etc...
           - What information should be updated, and for "where" in what table? 
           - Which line should be deleted?
         Prove that each of the functions work by having them run 2 times with different values at the start of your code.
